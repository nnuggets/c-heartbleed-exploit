#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_BUF_FREELISTS
/* On some platforms, malloc() performance is bad enough that you can't just
 * free() and malloc() buffers all the time, so we need to use freelists from
 * unused buffers.  Currently, each freelist holds memory chunks of only a
 * given size (list->chunklen); other sized chunks are freed and malloced.
 * This doesn't help much if you're using many different SSL option settings
 * with a given context.  (The options affecting buffer size are
 * max_send_fragment, read buffer vs write buffer,
 * SSL_OP_MICROSOFT_BIG_WRITE_BUFFER, SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION, and
 * SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS.)  Using a separate freelist for every
 * possible size is not an option, since max_send_fragment can take on many
 * different values.
 *
 * If you are on a platform with a slow malloc(), and you're using SSL
 * connections with many different settings for these options, and you need to
 * use the SSL_MOD_RELEASE_BUFFERS feature, you have a few options:
 *    - Link against a faster malloc implementation.
 *    - Use a separate SSL_CTX for each option set.
 *    - Improve this code.
